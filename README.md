# EggOrdersForecast
Find the number of eggs need to be ordered based on previous data

Customers buy eggs from our website between 10am and 10pm which are delivered next morning. Those eggs
are supplied by Egg vendors so an order needs to be sent to the vendors for those eggs at 6pm everyday. How
many eggs should we order from vendors to ensure every customer receives their eggs and we do not end up
with too many unsold eggs to minimize wastage?
